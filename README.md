# Biz Wiz - Visualization of csv files.

## Compile & Run
To compile for windows run the command g++ main.cpp -std=c++11 -lraylib -lopengl32 -lgdi32 -lwinmm
You will also need to have downloaded raylib, compiled it, and added it to the include/link path.

Then just run a.exe and a windows should appear like this! ![Rendering vsn in raylib](./pic.JPG) 

The readme will be expanded when the program actually does something...!
