# Biz Wiz - Visualization of csv files.
the future of business...

## Compile & Run
To compile for windows run the command `g++ main.cpp tinyxml2.cpp -std=c++11 -lraylib -lopengl32 -lgdi32 -lwinmm`

The project depends on raylib and tinyxml. Tinyxml is included in the project. but raylib is not.

So you will have to download raylib, compile it, and add it to the include/link path.

Then just run a.exe and a windows should appear like this! ![Rendering vsn in raylib](./pic.JPG) 

The readme will be expanded when the program actually does something...!
