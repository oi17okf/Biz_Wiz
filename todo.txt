- Preproccess data before to make it easier for subwindows to render data.

TYPES OF WINDOWS TO IMPLEMENT
- Key 0. Settings Panel. i.e open a new file for reading. Only 1 file at a time. (this should not be used that much, since it will default to a hardcoded file/run param.
- Key 1.View (almost) raw data. See everything contained in the read data file. How many traces, How many events. Event per trace. All trace keys, all event keys. 
	This might not be super useful but good for generating knowledge about the file type for me. It seems that concept:name and timestamp are the most relevant keys.
- Key 2. Interactable node graph. Allows for creating of nodes, connections. Sidebar with allowable actions. (all)Graph should be scrollable. Most graphs should reuse functionality.
- Key 3. View text Data in how it interacts with the constructed node graph. i.e how many traces passes, which ones don't.
- Key 4. View singular traces in node form (option to underlay the expected graph). Allows for viewing of all traces, but focus should be on 'bad traces'.
- Key 5. View difference from expected value in node form. Allows for viewing of all traces, but focus should be on 'bad traces'.
	All node graphs should be in the format of logical time + connection time. Displaying a number + color on each connection with a arrow giving direction.
	It should also match up with a linear wallclock timeline to the left. 
	This is nothing new, but is good to implement to get confortable. After, time to experiment with more things.
- Key 6. 


- fix small connection stuff, 
	add directions to conn, add event for setting direction



Known bugs:
- Renderer goes nuts when too much is on screen (despite it not being tthat much...)
- Content in windows are not resized well
-
